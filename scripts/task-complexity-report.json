      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Project Setup and Infrastructure task into 6 subtasks, focusing on Docker configuration, service setup, development environment, CI/CD pipeline, logging system, and database backup strategy. For each subtask, provide specific technical requirements and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (Docker, FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Nginx) and requires setting up the entire infrastructure. The complexity comes from ensuring all components work together correctly, configuring multi-stage builds, and implementing proper logging and backup systems."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Authentication System with Row Level Security task into 5 subtasks covering user model creation, JWT implementation, PostgreSQL Row Level Security configuration, frontend authentication flow, and security testing. Include specific technical details for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to security implications. Implementing JWT with refresh tokens requires careful handling of token storage, expiration, and refresh logic. PostgreSQL Row Level Security adds another layer of complexity, requiring deep database knowledge. The frontend authentication flow must be robust and handle various edge cases."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Core Data Models and Database Schema task into 6 subtasks covering user models, betting-related models, relationship definitions, database triggers, migration system, and index optimization. For each subtask, specify the entities involved and their relationships.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing a complex database schema with multiple interrelated entities. The requirement for UUID primary keys, PostgreSQL enums, automatic timestamps via triggers, and proper indexing adds significant complexity. The migration system is also critical for future database changes."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Advanced Betting Features task into 7 subtasks covering multiple bet support, freebet implementation, exchange betting, exit strategies, frontend wizard, timeline visualization, and automatic boost detection. For each subtask, provide detailed technical requirements and calculation methods.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks, involving sophisticated betting concepts like multiple bets, freebets, exchange betting with back/lay options, and multiple exit strategies. Each feature requires specific calculation logic and careful UI implementation. The timeline visualization adds significant frontend complexity."
